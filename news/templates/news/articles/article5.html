				<h1>The ghost of the ultimate opp</h1>
				
				<p>
					Ay ay ay was good people! Yeah welcome back to yet another one written as alway's by yours truly. Me. And today we will be covering non other than the legendary uchiha himself. The man, the legend and the myth. The man who need's no introduction seeing as how if you are an anime watcher it would be really hard for you to not come across this nigga. Non other than THE GHOST OF THE UCHIHA. UCHIHA MADARA. If you are reading this you probably already know madara is an opp but i don't think y'all understand how much of an opp this man is. As always imma give you the truth and nothing but the truth. No BS and with our regular entrance outa the way we can begin with today's segment.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Now if you don't know who in the absolute fuck madara is, i really don't know what to say to you man. Do you even watch anime? But anyway we are not here for people like them, nah, we are here for the ultimate opp. And my oh my does this man look like an opp. Bruh this man was so teriffying that he break's the law's of nature. Look at this man stand on top of a hill in the desert and there is wind. Yeah, wind in the desert. But nah my boi, we is still getting started. Now usually in anime when someone is getting jumped it's usually a 2vs1 or 3vs1 but this time it was 50 000vs1. And obviously with number's like that, people got confident. They really thought they were going to get the jump on madara. Nope, this man jumped all of them. BY HIMSELF. And this is where we get this iconic scene. Look at the man just get to work.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Now the naruto anime is based of ninja's with magic but they are still ninja's. And of all the ninja movies i've watched, ninja's are supposed to be low key and discrete. Madara is non of those things, he is in fact the complete 180 degrees of that. Nigga dropped a meteor just to prove that he could. And with a little teamwork and the power of plot(coz the MC was also there) they managed to stop the attack. Now in any other anime, when a bad guy releases an attack of this magnitude and they manage to stop it, he loses his shit. Madara? this man is just smiling and he actually happy they caught it. And then we obviously get that famous line "Just what exactly are you going to do about the second one?" Man dropped another meteor. This nigga really had gaara questioning if he was a god and gaara is the same person who is usually so chilled and confident that his sand will stop an attack but this time that was not the case. This is just like one of those situations when someone who is generally alway's happy and you have never seen angry actually get's angry. Yeah something like that.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Remember when i said this nigga madara out here breaking the law's of nature, look at this man over-power water with fire. I alway's thought that water was alway's stonger than fire but madara really don't give a fuck about the rules. It took all of them just to cancel out madara's one attack. But madara was still warming up. He was still getting his bones loose. Our boi naruto pull's up to square off against madara and initially when i saw this i was like madara bout to lose coz of plot. Nah, he beat the shit out of our MC and the hokages that were there. Look at them trying to surround madara thinking they bout to do something.(i'll put the susanoo part here). But nah, he ain't even done just yet. We are going to move on to where he is running the hand's with the 5 kage.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Now from my understanding, the 5 kage are suppsoed to be some of the strongest if not the strongest ninja's in the world. That was the general rule considering their title "Kage" but my oh my did madara just prove to us that, that rule doen't apply to him. It's a 5vs1 situation and you already know these kage's finna be talking heavy coz they have him out-numbered. Nigga! Ay gaara where you not there when this man single handely mopped the floor with 50 000 shinobi by himself. You know madara is about that life and yet you allow these other kage to be talking heavvvyy towards him. And my oh my did they pay for that. Man made 25 clones and gave each 5 madara's to deal with. And the he asks the most disrespectful question in all of anime history which i assume you already know what it it. "WOULD YOU LIKE THESE CLONES TO USE SUSANOO OR NOT?" Imagine getting jumped by 5 susanoo's. Yeah they where knocked the fuck out until plot kicked in again and dared madara to do something about it.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Yeah madara was not having non of that disrespect from plot armor so he just decided to take him up on his offer to do something. And his response? He pull's out this. Bruh just look at the size of this thing. Bruh what get's me is their facial expression when they see the size of this thing. "Where is that plot armor right about now" is what was going through their head's. Look at what he does right here. This nigga is like "the map's gotta be redrawn a little". But this is not even the craziest thing he did in this fight. All the dead opp's are being returned to where they were and now the kage are happy that madara is about to leave. But this man cast's the edo tensei on himself and he is back to life again. Yeah, he did that. And did i mention that everything madara has been doing up to this point has been in his base form. So it cut's back to where madara join's obito against naruto and the gang. Naruto obviously asking "ay ay ayy man, if you are here, what happend to everyone over there".
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Madara be like "Oh you talking about the niggas that really thought they were going to jump me? Yeah they not doing so well." Man bodied the 5 kage with the utmost ease and was even dissapointed that he didn't kill them after they saw the susanoo. So madara finally comes back to life coz the simp of 6 paths(obito) was taken hostage by a shadow. Now if you were dead and you are brought back to life, what is the first thing you would do when brough back to life. Imma tell you what madara did, this man decided to take on every ninja in the world + all the tailed beats and their jinchuriki and both main character's(naruto and sasuke) by himself. Madara takes that song it's just me, myself and i wayy to seriously. AND HE WAS BLIND! AND STILL IN HIS BASE FORM!! It was him against the world. LITERALLY. So when he tried running the 1's with tailed beast's it didn't end so well for him. That is until he get's one of his eye's. He open's it and boom all the tailed beast's dowm. yeah he also killed both naruto and sasuke.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Now with both our MC's outa commision GUY pull's up to run the hand's with madara. And he was actually beating the brakes off of madara. He was genuinly giving madara the hand's. Now as a bad guy, when you get a power up and you getting jumped, you are usually scared and do the iconic "nani!". Yeah madara did no such thing. This man was actually enjoying himself and asked guy "CAN U STILL DANCE?". GUY gives him the boot from hell and blow's half of madara of. And this nigga is just laughing. This man is laughing at the fact that you almost killed him. And then this is when plot start's to overpower madara as naruto and sasuke come back with new power's they got. And they way madara got killed was just pure plot. You telling me this madara, 10 tails absorbed, senjutsu, 4 limbo clones, dual rinnegan got sneaked by a shadow. A FUCKING SHADOW!! Bruh this is the same madara that could dodge tobirama's flying raijin from behind while blind. The same nigga that could react to minato's flying raijin and rasengan combo. AND YET AN EVEN STRONGER MADARA GOT SNEAKED BY A FUCKING SHADOW!!
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					This is just lazy writing right here. I'm sure plot had to get it's revenge after what madara had been doing all this time. But still, my man madara really got hoed right here. All for her to pull up. She is kinda cute tbh. But BS is still BS and i just felt i had to point that out. Anyway that is all i got for you for this one. If you liked it remember to sign up and share with your friends so that they too are informed of all the BS happening. It was a pleasure and imma see you on the next one. :)
