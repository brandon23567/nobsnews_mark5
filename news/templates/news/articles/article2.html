				<h1>Buu is one with the damn force!</h1>

				<p>
					Hello hello and welcome back to yet another one that is as alway's written by your's truly. And in today's segment we will be covering non other than buu himself. Now most of y'all probably know that thing where they rank character's who got black air force energy right? yeah buu should not be up there. This man does not have black air force energy, HE IS THE DAMN FORCE! The thing's this man does just make you as the viewer go "BRUH! IS THIS NIGGA SERIOUS". As always imma give you the truth and nothing but the truth. No BS. And with our usual intro outa da way we can continue on with today's segment
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Now we finna be covering fat buu first, chronological order type shit. Anyway obviously when you look at this nigga like this, he really doesn't look all that much but my oh my would you be wrong to judge just from his appearance. Coz he like that! Here is a quick fact, the reason supreme kai is supreme kai was coz buu killed everyone else. And that kinda makes sense coz this kai is weak as hell. I would just sit there and wonder to myself whose idea was this to make this nigga a supreme kai. But anyway that is not the point, now buu pull's up and everyone thinking to themselves "really nigga? All this hype for this." And buu was having non of that disrespect, non of it at all. Dabura, gone. Gohan? gone. Supreme kai? gone. He pulled up and dropped everyone on sight. Vegeta pulls up and y'all already know our favourite bout to be doing that HEAVVY TALKING.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					And what is it with these anime character's, don't you watch each other's show or somethin. If you start talking heavy, u gonna get your ass beat. Like vegeta, that last time you tried that with cell, you took a beating. And my oh my does everversion of buu turn vegeta into their personal punching bag, but more on that later. For now it's fat buu's turn. Look at this man beat the absolute breakes off majin vegeta. We is gonna skip the goku(ssj3) vs buu fight coz nothing really crazy happened there except the screaming montage by goku. And i hope these dragon ball voice acter's be paid a lot coz these screaming montages don't look very safe for you as a person. But enough of that, so buu continue's his killing spree like he is playing COD and he want's to call that air strike.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Now him and mr satan actually get along and become friend's. And this is how you know this man is a DEMON!, another version of himself comes out of his body and start's beating the brakes off of fat buu. Why? Coz he was caught lacking. He out here catching feeling's instead of catching bodies. Bruv, imagine beating yourself up for catching feeling's. Y'all remeber that thing madara said to tsunade, "WEAKNESS OF ANY KIND DISGUSTS ME" Yeah buu is the real defination of that. Fat buu tries turning this skinny buu into choclate and skinny buu was having non of that disrespect at all. Man's was like "first you catch feelings and you have the nerve to use my own attack on me!" and he blew it back and ate it him. He ate himself. Nah, he literally ate himself! And this is where this guy pull's up. And tbh, his design is low key kinda fire.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					When he pull's up, his smoke alarm goes off, coz he want's that smoke. It don't matter who it is. Now he is at the lookout and he demand's someone come and catch these hand's. Now picolo, who is supposed to be the smartest of the Z fighter's makes arguably the dumbest decision in all of anime. He tell's buu to have fun with all the human's that are stil left. You know DB really makes it hard for you as the viewer to connect with anything or anyone in the show why? Coz if they die y'all can just use the dragon ball's and bring them back, so there really is no sense of danger or thrill. Coz if someone does in DB my usual response is like give him a couple of episodes and he will be back. But that's not the point we is here for kid buu, so gotenks step's up to the plate to square up with super buu. And he got his ass beat. He he beat aa fusion character who was at ssj3, without a care in the world. Man had enough time to take a nap.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					That is until plot kicks in and is like "nah cuz, i'm the nigga running the show here. Not you." And the same gohan who got his ass beat by fat buu was actually beating super buu. And why? "Well umm, he got his potential unlocked that's why he is so strong". Yeah right. More like he got his plot armor unlocked. But atleast he looked like an opp when he was beating buu. Yeah, that is until buu absorbs gotenk's and then pull's out that uno reverse card on gohan. And man's was getting his ass jumped, he out here looking like "Where is that plot armor when you need it" So buu continues his absorbing spree. Gohan(absorbed!), piccolo(absorbed!) and our poster boys had to come back. And obviously there was no way they were beating super buu in 2v1 nevermind 1v1. So plot show's us why he didn't answer gohan's call earlier, coz he was still coming up with fusion. But damn, vegito is badass. Bruh he is literally the perfect fighter, he is strong as fuck and he talk's shit. What more could you want.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					And this man not only dog-walked super buu with all of those people absorbed, he also humiliates him. Bruh vegito is beating this man while talking shit at the same time. Now super buu turn's vegito into this ball and now he thinking "Yeah, i did that." Nah nigga u didn't do shit. Vegito was still beating his ass as a fucking ball(made of candy, or was it a sweet. Not sure, but y'all a;ready know what i'm talking about). So he manages to free everyone and then he defuses. Bruh there is something i gotta say, these fusion's be totally useless. Let's take cannon DB, there has never been an instance where a fusion pull's up and finishes the opponent. Nothing! The only time it happened wasn't even cannon(even though gogeta be looking like an opp). But other than that, it's useless. Against buu(fusion failed), against zamasu(fusion failed) and against broly(yeah it failed. AGAIN!)
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					But buu starts steaming again and he bout to transform and then the ultimate opp arrives. The opp of opp's. KID BUU. The president of BLACK AIR FORCE INC(CJDACAMP). Now all our villans we know they finna pull up and tell us all about how they are going to blow up the earth and all that shit. And it still puzzeles me, billions of planets in our universe and they all choose earth. Anyway i want cell and frieza to be taking notes coz they were busy throwing tantrums about how they are going to destroy the earth. Kid buu? Nah, he lifted his hand and BOOM!!! Bye bye earth. No talking, just action. And to make thing's even worse is that even toriyama understood the assignment. He knew his boi goku was fucked coz the first episode kid buu pull's up in is called THE END OF THE EARTH. Now that is how you make your introduction as a villan not these new boy's. If kid buu were to see DB's latest villans, he would be dissapointed.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					But this man did not end with destroying planet earth, he went planet to planet blowing it up coz he wanted nigga to run the hand's with. But this is where it get's crazy, this man went to heaven to run the hand's with all the dead opp's. U know kid buu may not look like it but he might actually be smart, man's was sick and tired of people alway's coming back with the dragon balls so he decided to go to heaven and permanantly delete them from the recycle bin. A full on CNTRL ALT DELETE. And if you think about it, this is a much more fun way to do the hakai than the way beerus does it. Yeah beerus is cool and all but, buu is those hand's on type of nigga's. literally.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					And obviously plot took him out. There was absoulely no need for buu to hold that thing. U could have dipped and come back later and unalived everyone. This man was trying to pull a jiren right here by pushing back the spirit bomb. But it's not your fault, nothing in the world of fiction is stronger than the power of plot. It's like playing a wrestling game and clearly you not supposed to win the match. But it is what it is.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Anyway that is all i got for you guy's today hope you liked that and stay tuned for even more like this. Remeber to sign up so that u don't miss out on more new's like this but with non of that BS and share with your friend's so that they too are informed of all this BS. It was a pleasure and imma see y'all on the next one. :)
