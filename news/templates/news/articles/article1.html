				<h1>Kakorot is about that life on god!</h1>

				<p>
					Ay was good? and welcome back to yet again another one written as always by yours truly. Today's segment we will be covering the father of anime, non other than son goku himself. Yeah everyone and their mom know's goku. Even the people that don't watch anime know about this man but this segment ain't about that, nah. This segment cover's a different side of goku. The part of him where his a an OPP. As alway's imma give you the truth and nothing but the truth. No BS. Yeah now that we know our main objective of today we will move on as planned.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Now goku is your typical shonen MC. As a matter of fact, this man is the damn blueprint of what most if not all our shonen MC's are like. They are dumb as fuck, light hearted and they all about the power of friendship and not giving up no matter what and all that bullshit. But even though goku is the poster boy for what shonen MC's are like, he is a walking contradiction. Yes don't get me wrong he has those qualities i mentioned above but there is a side to him that just does not give a fuck bout non of that. Y'all know those poll's on tiktok and youtube where they are telling you about character's who got black air force energy? yeah goku should be there and imma be telling you why coz this man is about that life. Welll... Kakarot at least.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Obviously your boi(me) finna give you a little bit of context so that you can understand why i say this man is about that life. Now it's DBS(the anime that is) and we introduced to beerus and whis who are a literal god and angel. So beerus is told by whis "Ay nigga, dis nigga goku is the man that unalived frieza" Intriged they start heading towards king kai's planet where goku is training. Now this is where it get's crazy coz goku is told "ay man listen up, beerus finna be pulling up and don't run the hand's with this man coz he is a god." Beerus land's and goku basically tell's him to square up. He like "ay beerus i'm told you are a god, so i assume that mean's you are strong. So put your hand's up". And the shock on beerus's face. Man's was like "IS THIS NIGGA SERIOUS". So i don't know if our definations of someone who is a GOD is different, but from my understanding a GOD is usually someone you don't want the smoke with and you do your best to avoid running up on him.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					But goku? This man was actively looking for the smoke, giving zero fuck's in the process. Bruv we are like in episode 4 and this man already challenging a GOD! But don't worry the show is just getting started. I'mma be skipping over the resurection F arc coz he really didn't do nothing too crazy and we is gonna head over to the goku black arc. And look at this man, he is dripped out as fuck. Look at how these color's just suit him so well. Yeah yeah i know that is not the point but i just felt i had to say that coz damn!! Anyway black was terorising our boi trunks(and you know sometimes i just feel like trunk's is the MC of DB or is being prepared to be the MC if something happen's to goku. Coz how does goku die and his weak ass survives but i may be mistaken) and they both pull up to the main timeline. I don't know bout you but all the movies where the MC or someone from the main cast see's a double of himself, he is usually scared and wondering HOW IN THE ABSOLUTE FUCK IS THIS HAPPENING!!
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Yeah goku didn't care about non of that, all he wanted to know was whether or not black could run the hand's with him. And he could. It is only after the fight that they start investigating the reason why black is around. Here's a question, IF YOU TRAVELLED TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE OR EVEN PLANET WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU WILL DO? Usually the people i knoe right know still wanna find out whether or not aliens actually exist and that is a totally valid reason. Goku? nah this man travelled to a whole other universe to run the hand's with a supreme kai. Bruh goku is the real defination of someone who's hand's are literally rated E for everyone, coz he don't care whether your a mortal or a god, he want's you to square up. But we all gotta respect goku for teaching us a very important lesson, it don't matter who they are as long as both of you got hand's, it's a fair fight.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					U know how naruto prefers talk no jutsu, yeah goku prefers hands no jutsu. And these kai's from the tenth be drinking a lot of tea. Bruh everytime u see this nigga's with a beverage, it's tea. But ay who i am to judge, maybe it's just their personal prefrence but i just thought i had to point that out. And wanna know something that is interesting? Goku is responsible for the death of trillions of mortal's and the god's as well. Like for real, if goku had not ran the hand's with zamasu many people would still be alive, but goku being goku, his love for the smoke overshadow's everything else. Anyway let us move to pre tournament of power goku coz this is where i feel this man(nah nah, this DEMON) is HIM!!
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					So as of know we know that goku is not beating beerus in a 1v1 fight right? Not to mention any of the angels. Now we are introduced to the GRAND PRIEST and GRAND ZENO. Like look at them! They look like children and they are harmless and all that. And TBH, the grand priest is kinda cute but this is where goku breaks anime rule number 5, IF THEY LOOK LESS INTIMIDATING, THEY STRONG AS FUCK. Did goku follow this, nope. He wanted to run the hand's with the grand priest. The nigga who is second only to the omni king and he wanted to run his pocket's. And whis is the person who sum's up this scene properly, man's was like "Ay ay ay goku, i know you got hand's and u is about that life, but this little nigga is one person you don't want the smoke with. On beerus! bruh" And obviously he let that slide coz he understood that if whis is scared, so should he. And besides that, the reason why so many universes where on the line was because goku wanted to run the hand's with people who are even stronger than him.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					If you really wanna run the 1's, go to vegeta's place and y'all can fight for years but nah goku want's to experience new things. But atleast from all his shenanigan's we got to see MUI. And is it just me or is beerus are really really good hype man. "GOKU! ARE U FINISHED!!" But goku in the manga? Yeah this man is just a walking middle finger when he feel's like it. U know morro was the bad guy but i felt sorry for him, coz this nigga goku pull's up and beat's his ass. And then he gives him a sensu bean so that he is back at full power, and he drop's him. AGAIN!!! Bruh this is the type of shit that is supposed to be done by our villan's but nah this was done by our MAIN CHARACTER. Remeber what i told you about goku teaking the blueprint he made and throwing it out the window, yeah this is it.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					And he doesn't even end there, this nigga goku has the nerve to ask him "Ay bruh, do u even train?" When was the last time you saw the MC hopelessly over-power the bad guy who is supposed to be at least relative to him. Yeah we are not going to be talking about the granola arc coz reasons. The only good things from that arc was UE VEGETA, TUI GOKU and BLACK FRIEZA. Otherwise it's kinda mid tbh. Yeah that is all i got for y'all today and if you want for new's that does not include any of the BS you get watching these show's, sign up to noBSnews and share with your friend's so that they are also informed. But anyway imma see y'all on the next 1. :)
