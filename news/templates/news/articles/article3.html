				<h1>I think someone gotta tell my man ichigo here that he gotta let some shit slide.</h1>

				<p>
					Ay ay ay was good people!! Welcome once again to yet another one written as always by yours truly and today we will be covering one of the members of the legendary big 3. ICHIGOAT KUROSAKI. But we ain't here to talk about his influence and the power of friendship and all that nonesense, nah we here coz ichigo is a DAWG. He is about that life. As always imma give you the truth and nothing but the truth. No BS. And with our intro outa the way we can get this show on the road.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The shonen MC. Arguably the most common type of MC there is in the world of anime. I might go as far as to say probably your favourite MC is from a shonen anime and if not atleast one of them is. They are all about never giving up, chasing your dreams and goals and the power of friendship, they are dumb and goofy. U know the typical MC. Goku, naruto and luffy are good examples of this. But we are not here for that power of friendship BS and neither does ichigo. Ichigo is arguably the most relatable MC we have. Coz check this, if someone does something bad to you or one of your loved ones, are you going to tell them about the power of friendship and get them to change their way's or are you going to get revenge. It's obviously revenge, come on now. Let's not kid ourselves here. And ichigo don't forget. He is not the forgive and forget type. If you run up on ichigo like that, you best believe that he ain't gonna let that shit just slide coz he the MC.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Now we finna start off with big bad DADDY AIZEN. Yeah this man is a problem. Even the people that don't like bleach know who dafuq aizen is. But that's not the point, the thing is, this man aizen disrespected ichigo. And i don't think this deserves to be called disrespect. Imma try to find another word for disrespect and imma edit it back into this segement but for now just know this is beyond disrespect. This man stopped ichigo's attack and theme song with a finger. In front of all these captain's and even worse, in front of ichigo's girl. This nigga didn't even bother to use his sword, he like this finger should be more than enough. And my god look at ichigo's facial expression. Man's looking like "Ay kubo! am i not the mai character of this damn show. So what the fuck is happening here." Like when have you seen in naruto(i'mma use naruto as an example) where that flute start's playing and someone just stop's it. Giving zero fucks in the process. Like bruh, when that flute start playing you know somebody bout to receive that rasengan real quick. But aizen? He didn't care bout non of that.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					So what does ichigo do during their final part? This. Yeah this is an even stronger aizen and ichigo does that so casually. Look at the shock on aizen's face. Man's is like "Ay this nigga still holding that grudge till this day?" Till this day! Till this day my boi. U see ichigo is the type of man u don't wanna mess with. He is the defination of what comes around goes around and he ain't even done yet. So we finna go to the arrancar arc where aizen is just low diffing all the captain's with ease. Bruh, i thought that even though there was a gap in power between captain's, it woudln't be that big, but aizen just proved me wrong. And gin is out here hyping aizen up. He like "EVEN IF THE SKY IS TO COLLAPSE, Y'ALL STILL AIN'T GONNA BEAT AIZEN". Man's made it rain captain's. Literally. And now ichigo pull's up and he start's swinging and obviously aizen just weaving that with the absolute ease. This is the best part, ichigo start's keeping his distance and aizen start's talking heavy.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					He like "why are you running away from me like i couldn't reach you if i wanted to" And you already know ichigo is having non of that disrespect at all. So in their final fight again, ichigo say's this. Bruh this man literally said what aizen said to him word for word and you already know aizen finna have a mental breakdown. Coz the same ichigo he disrespected about 10 episodes ago is the same one giving him the hand's(sword in this case). Das why ichigo is called ICHIGOAT. Coz he is a DAWG. He has no time for some talk no jutsu or power of friendship BS, if you mess with ichigo best believe he gon mess with you. Now the next one on ichigo's list of victims is non toher than hueco mundo's most notorious opp. Grimjow jagerjages(yeah i don't know how to spell it) but y'all already can tell that grimjow is about that life. Just look at his last name. That shit on it's own sound dangerous as fuck. Imagine just chilling and you here MR.JAGRJAQUES is here for you. It sound's like his from some dangerous ass gang or somethin
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					So this man got the jump on ichigo and turned him into his own personal punching bag. Like at this beating right here. And this time ichigo is only 17 and these are the nigga's who are jumping him. This nigga grimjow even turned ichigo into a ping pong, kicking him around for absoluely nothing. This man left HQ to run the hand's, for the fun of it. And you already know ichigo ain't gonna let that shit slide. Now they get to boxing in their final fight and it kinda look's like an even fight. Welll that is until orihime reminds ichigo of what grimjow did to him in his own turf. And this man just decides "ay cuz, yeah here's the deal, i just remebered what you did to me and i don't feel like losing anymore". Just look at this man. Bruh this match went from being 50/50 to ichigo just dog walking grimjow.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Yeah ichigo got that DAWG in him. That is besides zangetsu(coz this man is a DEMON!. Literally and Figuratively) So the next nigga that disrespected ichigo and had to pay with his life is ulqioura(don't know if that spelling is right) but this man dog walked ichigo. And i mean dog walked, it wasn't even close and he would have died if he hadn't been for grimjow's love for the smoke. U know when i actually think about, grimjow brought his opp back to life so that they could run the hand's. So ulqioura be beating the absolute brakes off of ichigo. And this is where ulqioura chose to relinquish his life. Man made ichigo join the donut club, IN FRONT OF HIS GIRL. Y'all know that meme where they be like "It was at this moment he knew, he fucked up" yeah this was it. But i am kinda grateful for him blowing a hole through ichigo coz we got to see this absolute tank! That is the VASTO LORDE. And this is what he does to him.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Yeah i almost forgot about the first 2 nigga that got the jump on ichigo. Byakuya and renji. Renji got his ass jumped so did byakuya. Ichigo don't forget and the funny part is he got his revenge back in chronoligal order. That is some good memory right there. Yeah that is all i got for you today and if you liked it remember to sign up and share with other's so that they are also informed of the new's but with non of the BS. As alway's it was a pleasure and imma see you on the next one. :)
